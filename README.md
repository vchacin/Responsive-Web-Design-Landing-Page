# landing-page

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for your interest in my project.

It's a replica of the Apple product landing page.

It constitutes the exercise to obtain the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design certification.

Pull requests are welcome, feel free to collaborate. Was made with HTML and CSS.

## Take a look!
